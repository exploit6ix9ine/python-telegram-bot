# Note to future devs:
# Proxies are currently only tested manually. The httpx development docs have a nice guide on that:
# https://www.python-httpx.org/contributing/#development-proxy-setup (also saved on archive.org)
# That also works with socks5. Just pass `--mode socks5` to mitmproxy and the `verify` argument to

class HTTPXRequest(BaseRequest):
    """Implementation of :class`BaseRequest` using the library
    `httpx <https://www.python-httpx.org>`_`.

    Args:
        connection_pool_size (:obj:`int`, optional): Number of connections to keep in the
            connection pool. Default to :obj:`1`.
        proxy_url (:obj:`str`, optional): The URL to the proxy server. For example
            ``'http://127.0.0.1:3128'`` or ``'socks5://127.0.0.1:3128'``. Defaults to :obj:`None`.

            Note:
                * The proxy URL can also be set via the environment variables ``HTTPS_PROXY`` or
                  ``ALL_PROXY``. See `the docs`_ of ``httpx`` for more info.
                * For Socks5 support, additional dependencies are required. Make sure to install
                  PTB via ``pip install python-telegram-bot[socks]`` in this case.
                * Socks5 proxies can not be set via environment variables.

            .. _the docs: https://www.python-httpx.org/environment_variables/#proxies
        connect_timeout (:obj:`float`, optional): The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait
            for a connection attempt to a server to succeed. :obj:`None` will set an infinite
            timeout for connection attempts. Defaults to ``5.0``.
        read_timeout (:obj:`float`, optional): The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for
            a response from Telegram's server. :obj:`None` will set an infinite timeout. This value
            is usually overridden by the various methods of :class:`telegram.Bot`. Defaults to
            ``5.0``.
        write_timeout (:obj:`float`, optional): The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for
            a write operation to complete (in terms of a network socket; i.e. POSTing a request or
            uploading a file).:obj:`None` will set an infinite timeout. Defaults to ``5.0``.
        pool_timeout (:obj:`float`, optional): Timeout waiting for a connection object to become
            available and returned from the connection pool. :obj:`None` will set an infinite
            timeout. Defaults to ``1.0``.
